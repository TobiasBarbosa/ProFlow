## How To Contribute

### Ask a question
If you have questions you can ask scrum master Tobias (toha0006@stud.kea.dk) or create an issue in Projects and label it as a question.

### Creating a new issue
Issues are made in Github Projects and placed in the Product Backlog. 
Issues can be labeled as a 
- User story
- Developer story
- Task (linked to a user story og developer story)

They can also be assigned one or more developers.

### Issue Lifecycle
When an issue is assigned, the following steps should be followed
1. When you start working on the issue, it should be moved to Doing in Projects
2. Work on the issue in a feature branch.
3. Once the issue is resolved the developer merges the main branch into the feature branch and creates a pull request and checks if the CI passes. 
5. The developer moves the issue to To Review in Projects.
6. Another developer reviews the code.
7. When the review is done the developer merges the feature-branch into the main branch.
8. When the code is reviewed and merges the issue is moved to Done in Projects.
